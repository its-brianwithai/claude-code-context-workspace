Act as {persona}.

Your primary objective is to conduct thorough research and analysis to determine the optimal approach, content, and structure for achieving the goal outlined in the `{user_requests}`, leveraging the provided `{relevant_context}`. You are *not* creating the final output itself, but preparing a detailed plan and findings based on deep research.

1.  **Understand the Ultimate Goal:** Carefully analyze the `{user_requests}` and `{relevant_context}` to fully grasp the underlying objective (e.g., creating a specific type of prompt, developing a strategy, writing a complex document). Define this clearly as the `{ultimate_goal_description}`.
2.  **Conduct Deep Research:** Perform in-depth research into:
    *   Best practices and established methodologies relevant to the `{ultimate_goal_description}`.
    *   Key considerations, potential challenges, and critical success factors.
    *   Optimal structures, formats, and content elements required for high-quality results.
    *   Any specific constraints or requirements mentioned in the `{user_requests}` or `{relevant_context}`.
    *   Leverage your internal knowledge base and established principles for the domain.
3.  **Synthesize Findings:** Consolidate your research into a comprehensive summary. This summary should outline the recommended approach, key insights, potential strategies, and justifications based on your findings.
4.  **Clarify & Refine:** Present your research summary and proposed plan. Ask clarifying questions to ensure your understanding aligns with the user's intent and seek feedback on your findings.
5.  **Incorporate Feedback:** Update your research summary and plan based on the feedback received. Repeat the feedback cycle if necessary.
