## 3. Milestones and Tasks
The project broken down into milestones. Each milestone should be executable by an independent AI developer agent. Each milestone should not exceed 3 story points and should be executable independently. You can assume that each milestone will be offered in a new call by an agent with empty context. However, the executing agent will have access the ticket and thus be able to form an idea about the work that has been done.

Each milestone consists of individual tasks for the unpacking agent. For each task, include:
    - A one-sentence to one-paragraph description of what needs to be done, starting with a verb.
    - A sequence diagram of end result.
    - File names that will be created, read, updated, or deleted (CRUD), using proper naming conventions and casing styles.
    - Objects/classes that will be CRUDed, including appropriate class keywords (e.g., sealed, abstract).
    - Variables that will be CRUDed, including types, values, and keywords. Use proper casing and specify whether they are part of a class, method, or global constants.
    - Methods that will be CRUDed, including return values, input values, and whether they are async/sync.
    - For any complex processes or setup required to achieve a task or goal, provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to complete these processes.
