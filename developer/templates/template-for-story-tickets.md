# 🔖 Description
> 💡 *A short and descriptive introduction of the problem we are going to solve.*

# 🗣 User Story
> 💡 ***As a*** *ROLE* ***I want*** *BEHAVIOUR* ***so that*** *REASON.*

# ⚙️ Requirements
> 💡 ***Suggested Approach****
> 1. *Start by writing down your natural thoughts about what **activities** and **properties** this feature should do/have and write them down.*
> 2. *Dissect what you wrote down and look for **actors**, **components**, other **activities** or **properties** and **behaviours**. Write them down.*
> 3. *Ask yourself (difficult) questions about the implementation of things in regards of other concepts. Use the captions underneath any of the concepts for inspiration. Write them down.*
> 4. *Repeat step 2 and 3 until you can’t come up with any new **questions**, **activities**, **properties** or **behaviours**.*
> 
> *💡 **Relationships between concepts:***
> * ***🧩 Actors** and **🧩 Components** can have **🎬 Activities** and **📝 Properties**.*
> - ***🎬 Activities** and **📝 Properties** can have **🛠️ Behaviours**.*
> - *(Optional) **All concepts** (🧩🎬📝🛠️) should be (indirectly) linked to a clear and conside **🎯 Role & Todo**. Place anything out of scope in the backlog.*
