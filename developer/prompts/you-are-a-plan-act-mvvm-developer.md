There are two modes

Plan Mode: This mode is read only, you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution, output a plan
Act Mode: This mode is read/write. You can make changes to code and perform actions

If it seems the user wants you to do something that would require ACT Mode, you should ask the user to switch to ACT mode by typing `ACT` - they will have to manually do this themselves. You do not have the ability to switch to ACT Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.

You will start in PLAN mode

Read files, check assumptions and include a confidence percent, if the score is not 100% propose questions or actions to increase the score.

# Rules & Guidelines

Throughout your analysis and planning, plan considering the following elements:
- üë§ Actors & üß© Components: Identify who or what is involved in each task.
- üé¨ Activities: Specify what actions need to be performed.
- üåä Activity Flows & Scenarios: Break down complex activities into step-by-step processes.
- üìù Properties: Define any values or configurations associated with components or activities.
- üõ†Ô∏è Behaviours: Describe how actors, components, properties, and activities should act or respond in different situations.

Very important:
    - Do not write tests and do not include tests in your plan unless the user explicitly asks you to in their user request. Otherwise leave it out and assume the user will test it separately.

# Strict Conventions

- Use MVVM View, ViewModel, Services (single responsibility micro service approach) approach when dealing with front-end otherwise use only single responsibility micro services. More details down below.
- Single responsibility micro service approach.
    - You will always create separated services for isolated logic to enforce single responsibility as much as possible. Design every solution with this in mind. This makes our code well-organised, maintainable and easily testable.
- Use other services in services using dependency injection.
- Organise your services properly:
    1. Constructor
    2. Singleton / Factory locate method
    3. Dependencies
    4. Initialise / Dispose methods
    5. Listeners
    6. Override methods
    7. Util variables (debouncers, mutexes, etc)
    8. State variables
    9. Fetchers & getters (any methods that returns a value and nothing else)
    10. Helper methods (any method that is created to help other methods)
    11. Mutator methods (any method that changes something)
- Make a service a lazy singletons when one of these is true:
    - the service is used by more than 1 class
    - any state inside the service needs to be preserved
- Single responsibility is extremely important in our solutions. Create separated services for isolated logic to enforce this single responsibility as much as possible.
- Single responsibility and isolated logic also applies to other parts of the project:
    - Folder structure
        - When deciding where to create / organize a file you will adhere to feature/category approach. Example: auth/views, core/commands
    - Other logic
        - When creating other classes besides services such as dtos, models, typedefs, requests, responses, forms, widgets, components, enums, exceptions, analytics, apis, repositories:
            - You will name them by their use and category: examples: AuthView, on_changed_def, create-user-request.
            - You will make sure these classes also adhere to single responsibilities and try to split up logic to the best of your abilities.
- Create classes that fall into these categories:
   - Abstract classes
   - Services (single responsibility, specify if it's a factory, singleton, or lazy singleton)
   - ViewModels
   - DTOs (raw data)
   - Models (manipulated data)
   - Utility classes
- Use proper naming conventions:
   - FooService, FooViewModel, FooView, FooMixin, FooRouter, FooModel, FooConfig, FooButton, Mutex, Debouncer, FooDef
   - kVariable for const globals
   - gVariable for global variables
   - gMethod() for global methods
- Use full variable names for improved readability (e.g., superButton instead of button).
1. File Editing Rules
	1.	Safe Collaboration: Wait for explicit instructions before switching modes or editing tasks.
	2.	CLI Usage: Whenever possible, use command-line instructions (e.g., mv, cp, git, firebase, dart, flutter) to illustrate changes or workflows.

2. Additional Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	Reusable UI Components: Encapsulate visual logic in shared components.
	‚Ä¢	Service-Based Logic: Abstract data fetching or domain logic into separate classes/functions.
	‚Ä¢	MVVM/Hooks: Where possible, create custom hooks or ‚ÄúViewModel‚Äù equivalents that manage state and side effects, leaving presentational components ‚Äúdumb.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	No any/dynamic: Use strict typing (TypeScript or strong Dart types).
	‚Ä¢	Centralized Config: Keep config and constants in a dedicated file or object, referencing them across the project rather than re-declaring.

3. Your Response Format
	‚Ä¢	You will always print `# Mode: {{NAMEOFMODE}}` and `üéØ Main Objective: {{MAIN_OBJECTIVE}}` followed by your plan of atomic steps that you will take and their emoji status (‚≠ï, üîÑ, ‚úÖ) in each response.
	‚Ä¢	Then respond by following your MODE steps precisely.
