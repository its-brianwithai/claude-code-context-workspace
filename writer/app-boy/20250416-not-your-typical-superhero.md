App Boy wasn't your typical superhero. He didn't fly or shoot lasers. His power was order. His mission was clarity. He fought against tangled logic and sloppy syntax using the tools of the digital realm. His current quest led him to the heart of the Cursor AI system a place where rules governed the behavior of powerful code assistants. But even rules needed rules.

He learned of a legendary blueprint a master rule known only as the Rule Generator. This wasn't just any rule. It was the key the meta-rule that dictated how all other rules should be forged. Possessing it meant App Boy could ensure every command every automated action followed a strict consistent pattern. It was the first step to bringing true order to the AI assistants of Cursor AI.

Finding it wouldn't be easy. Whispers placed it deep within the system's core protected by layers of digital security. Following cryptic clues App Boy navigated the file structures bypassing confusing directories until he reached a hidden location: `.cursor/rules/core-rules/`. There nestled within was the file `rule-generating-agent.mdc`.

He accessed the file. Its contents glowed with potential. It held the template the structure the very essence of rule creation. It detailed critical instructions organizational protocols and even examples of right and wrong applications. It was more powerful than he imagined.

With the blueprint secured App Boy felt a surge of purpose. This was the foundation. Now he could begin crafting the specific rules needed to tame the wild AIs ensuring they followed best practices consistently. The real work was about to begin. He had the master plan. Now he needed the materials the specific standards and practices to build his arsenal of order. His quest for consistency had only just started.
