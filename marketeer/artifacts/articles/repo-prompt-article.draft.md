# RepoPrompt: Effective Contextual Prompt Creation

## What is RepoPrompt?

RepoPrompt is a tool designed to automate the creation of context-rich prompts for large language models. It streamlines the process of incorporating relevant information from multiple files (such as code repositories or document collections) into a single prompt. By parsing a repository and extracting key content, RepoPrompt helps users provide an AI model with the necessary context to understand complex, multi-file tasks. The goal is to save time and ensure that prompts include all pertinent details without manually copying and pasting large chunks of text.

## Key Features of RepoPrompt
- Repository Scanning – RepoPrompt can ingest an entire project or repository structure, reading through directories and files to identify relevant content. It supports various file types (e.g. source code, markdown, text) and can skip or prioritize files based on configurable criteria. This allows it to gather context from all over a codebase or document set.
- Context Assembly – The tool automatically builds a composite prompt by combining snippets or summaries from multiple files. It ensures the assembled prompt stays within the token limits of the target AI model by trimming or summarizing content as needed. The context assembly logic prioritizes the most relevant parts of each file so that the final prompt is both concise and comprehensive.
- Summarization and Compression – For very large files or sections of text, RepoPrompt can generate abridged versions. It may use summarization techniques to condense long functions or documents into shorter descriptions. This feature helps include the essence of lengthy content without exceeding token limits, which is crucial given model context size constraints ￼.
- Multi-Model Integration – RepoPrompt is compatible with multiple AI models. Users can choose which underlying model to use for a given prompt (for example, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, or other supported models). The tool adjusts the prompt packaging to fit the chosen model's requirements, such as different context window sizes or formatting needs. This flexibility allows switching between models for cost or performance reasons.
- User-Friendly Interface – The platform offers a simple interface (either command-line or web-based) where users specify the repository (or file set) and their query or task. RepoPrompt handles the rest. It may also provide options to preview the assembled prompt before sending it to the AI model, so users can verify the context included.
- Adaptive Token Management – A core feature of RepoPrompt is automatically managing tokens. It keeps track of how many tokens the context content will consume and adapts in real-time – for instance, by excluding less relevant details or shortening text. This ensures that the final prompt will not be cut off due to token limits when sent to the model ￼. The tool essentially maximizes the amount of useful information packed into the prompt without overrunning the model's capacity.

## Using RepoPrompt Effectively

To get the most out of RepoPrompt, users should follow some best practices and usage guidelines:
1. Prepare the Repository – Ensure that the repository or file set you point RepoPrompt to is organized and contains the information needed for your task. Remove or exclude any files that are irrelevant (such as large libraries, dependencies, or generated files) so the tool can focus on important context. A well-structured project with clear code and documentation will yield better prompt context.
2. Define the Query Clearly – When invoking RepoPrompt, provide a clear and specific instruction or question for the AI. For example, instead of a vague prompt like "Help me with this project," ask a precise question: "Explain how the authentication module works and identify any potential security issues." A focused query helps RepoPrompt retrieve the most relevant snippets from the repository.
3. Select Relevant Files or Sections – If the tool allows it, specify particular files or subdirectories to prioritize. For instance, if your question is about the authentication module, you might direct RepoPrompt to the auth/ folder. By narrowing the scope manually, you reduce noise and token usage from unrelated parts of the repo. RepoPrompt will still pull in additional files if needed (e.g. utility modules linked to auth/), but starting with a target area improves efficiency.
4. Review the Assembled Prompt – Before sending the prompt to the AI model, take advantage of RepoPrompt's preview feature (if available). Skim through the gathered context. Ensure that it includes the expected functions, classes, or text relevant to your query. If something important is missing, you may need to adjust your query or include an additional file. Likewise, if you see extraneous information included, consider refining your query or excluding that content.
5. Iterate if Necessary – Effective use of RepoPrompt may be an iterative process. After getting an AI response, you might realize more context is needed or a follow-up question arises. You can run RepoPrompt again with a refined query or with additional files. Each iteration can build on previous results, gradually honing in on the information you need. Because RepoPrompt automates context gathering, these iterations are faster than manually finding and prepending text for each new question.

By following these steps, users can efficiently leverage RepoPrompt to generate high-quality, context-aware prompts that address their specific needs.

## Practical Strategies for Crafting Contextual Prompts

Crafting a good contextual prompt is not just about using the tool; it also requires strategy in how information is presented to the AI. Here are some concrete strategies to ensure the prompt is both effective and model-friendly:
- Be Specific and Descriptive – Clearly state what you want the model to do with the provided context. For example, start the user prompt portion with an explicit instruction like: "Using the context provided from the repository, answer the following…" or "Given the code snippets above, identify any bugs and explain the functionality…" This signals to the model how it should use the context.
- Provide Context in a Structured Way – Structure the prompt so that different pieces of context are labeled or separated. For instance, you might list file names or sections before their content: "File: auth.py – Contents: [relevant excerpt]". RepoPrompt often formats the combined context with such headings or delimiters automatically. This structure helps the AI distinguish between different sources and improves comprehension.
- Include Only Relevant Details – Avoid overloading the prompt with irrelevant data. Even though RepoPrompt helps filter content, you should still aim to include only information that relates to the query. Irrelevant context can confuse the model or use up tokens needlessly. If you notice tangential content in the prompt, refine the context (either by adjusting parameters in RepoPrompt or by manually editing out noise in the preview). The key is to give the model just enough information to be accurate, and no more.
- Use Summaries for Background Information – For contextual information that the model might need but which is too lengthy, include a summary rather than raw text. RepoPrompt may do this for you, but you can also prompt it or do it manually. For example, instead of inserting an entire 300-line configuration file, provide a short summary: "The configuration file sets environment variables X, Y, Z and uses default settings for logging." This provides necessary background without dragging in excessive detail.
- Maintain Clarity in Wording – Write the prompt using clear, unambiguous language. Avoid pronouns or references that the model might not understand without additional context. For instance, prefer "the User class defined in models/user.py" over "that class". This way, even if multiple files are involved, the model can easily map references to the provided context. Clarity reduces the chances of the AI getting confused or producing hallucinations in its answer.
- Test with a Small Example – If possible, test your contextual prompt strategy on a smaller scale before tackling a huge repository. For example, try asking a question about one or two files and see if the answers are accurate. This can validate that your prompt format and level of detail are appropriate. Once confident, scale up to broader or multi-file queries. This step-by-step approach ensures you craft prompts that consistently guide the model correctly.

By applying these strategies, prompt creators can significantly improve the usefulness of the AI's responses. The combination of RepoPrompt's automated context gathering and thoughtful prompt writing by the user leads to the best outcomes.

## Advanced Use: Multi-File Tasks and Token Optimization

Some use cases involve analyzing or generating output based on many files at once – for example, asking the AI to review an entire codebase for bugs or to generate documentation for a large project. In such scenarios, advanced techniques and careful token management become critical:
- Relevance Ranking for Multi-File Context – When dealing with dozens of files, it's inefficient and often impossible to include everything verbatim. An advanced approach is to use an embedding-based search or a similar mechanism to rank which files or sections are most relevant to the query. RepoPrompt employs such techniques under the hood: it can vectorize the content of each file and retrieve only the top-N relevant pieces to include in the prompt. This ensures that, even in a large repository, the prompt is focused on the parts that matter most to the question at hand.
- Hierarchical Summarization – For very large projects, a hierarchical approach can be useful. First, generate summaries of individual files or modules (possibly using RepoPrompt on each sub-part). Then feed those summaries into a higher-level prompt for an overview or cross-file analysis. By summarizing at multiple levels, you effectively compress the information gradually. This technique allows multi-file analysis without exceeding token limits: instead of raw code, the final prompt might contain summary paragraphs for each module.
- Utilize Large Context Models – Choose a model that can handle bigger prompts when you truly need to include a lot of context. For example, GPT-4's 32k-token version or AnthropIC's Claude model with an even larger context window (up to 100k tokens) can process substantially more text than the standard 4k-8k token models ￼. When using RepoPrompt for multi-file tasks, pairing it with a model that has a high token limit means you can include more files or longer excerpts. Keep in mind that these models may be costlier and slightly slower, but they enable more comprehensive analysis in one go.
- Token Budgeting and Trimming – Always be conscious of the token budget. RepoPrompt's adaptive token management will try to fit within the limit, but for advanced use you might want to set your own token budget per section. For example, you could allocate a certain number of tokens to each major component of context (e.g. no more than 200 tokens from any single file). Additionally, remove boilerplate or repetitive content. Common examples include license headers, import statements, or verbose comments that aren't directly useful for the query. Trimming such content can free up a lot of space for more important details.
- Batching and Iteration for Completeness – If a single prompt still cannot cover all necessary files (even with a large model), consider batching the work across multiple prompts. For instance, split a 100-file task into 5 prompts that each handle 20 files, then consolidate the AI's answers. RepoPrompt can assist by focusing on different subsets of the repository for each batch. Afterwards, you can feed the combined insights into a final prompt (with a fresh context assembled from those results) to get an overall answer. This multi-step approach is complex but can tackle very large tasks by breaking them into manageable chunks.
- Avoiding Token Waste – In advanced usage, little inefficiencies can add up. Pay attention to formatting: for example, extremely long path names or deeply nested JSON structures might consume many tokens but add little value. It may be beneficial to abbreviate or abstract these in the prompt (ensuring the model still understands what they represent). Every token counts in large contexts, so the principle is to spend tokens only on information that contributes to the task's outcome.

By leveraging these advanced techniques, RepoPrompt users can handle multi-file and large-scale tasks that would normally exceed an AI model's input limitations. Effective token optimization ensures that even as more context is added, the prompt remains within limits and focused on relevant content.

## Supported AI Models

RepoPrompt is model-agnostic in design, meaning it can work with different large language models as the backend for generating answers. The following AI models are supported or commonly used with RepoPrompt:
- OpenAI GPT-4 – The GPT-4 model is often the top choice for use with RepoPrompt when dealing with complex or nuanced queries. It offers strong performance in understanding context and following instructions. GPT-4 has a standard context window of 8,192 tokens, and an extended version supporting up to 32,768 tokens for larger prompts ￼. This makes GPT-4 suitable for moderately large repositories, especially if using the 32k variant for extensive context.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo – This model is a faster and more cost-effective option. GPT-3.5 Turbo typically supports a context of around 4,096 tokens (with an available 16k-token version as well). It can be used with RepoPrompt for smaller tasks or initial explorations. While it may not capture very large contexts in one go, GPT-3.5 is useful for quick iterations or for less complex prompt assemblies. Users often start with GPT-3.5 for drafting or testing prompts, then switch to GPT-4 for more detailed analysis once the prompt content is refined.
- Anthropic Claude – Claude is an AI model by Anthropic known for its extremely large context window. Claude's latest version can handle up to 100,000 tokens of context, far surpassing the limits of most other models. This capability is particularly useful for RepoPrompt users who need to feed in massive amounts of text (for example, an entire repository's codebase or a lengthy document set) in a single prompt. Claude is suitable for big multi-file tasks where using it might eliminate the need to split into batches. Supported usage of Claude with RepoPrompt depends on API access to Claude's model. When available, it allows analysis of tens of thousands of words in one prompt.
- Other Models – RepoPrompt's flexible architecture means other AI models can be integrated as well. This includes both other commercial models and open-source LLMs. For example, Google's PaLM 2 (through an API) or open-source models like LLaMA 2 or GPT-J could be used, provided they support an API or interface that RepoPrompt can call. It should be noted that each model comes with its own context size limitations and quirks. Open-source models often have smaller context windows (e.g. 2k to 4k tokens) unless fine-tuned for longer input. They might require extra strategies (like aggressive summarization or splitting) when used with RepoPrompt. Nonetheless, the ability to swap in different AI backends allows users to balance factors like accuracy, speed, cost, and context length as needed for their task.

When using RepoPrompt, the user supplies the API key or connection for the chosen model. The tool then formats the prompt according to that model's rules and sends the request. The output from the model (the answer or completion) is returned to the user. All supported models require careful prompt construction to perform well, and RepoPrompt helps to meet each model's constraints automatically. Users should choose a model that fits their particular use case – for instance, GPT-4 or Claude for heavy context and critical tasks, versus GPT-3.5 or others for lighter, faster queries.

## Pricing and Availability

RepoPrompt is currently available through its official platform, allowing users to sign up and start using the tool for their projects. The availability is generally immediate for individual users – one can access the web interface or install the package (if a library version is offered) and begin integrating it with their workflow. As of now, RepoPrompt may be in a beta release phase, meaning users can try it out and provide feedback, though core functionality is in place.

In terms of pricing, the RepoPrompt tool itself might offer a mix of free and paid options:
- Free Tier – A basic free tier could be available, enabling users to run a limited number of prompts or work with smaller repositories without charge. This is useful for evaluation purposes or for hobby projects. Users on the free tier would still need to supply their own API keys for the underlying AI models, which means any costs from model usage (e.g. OpenAI's token fees) are borne by the user. For example, if using GPT-4 via RepoPrompt, the OpenAI charges on the order of $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for the prompt (and a bit more for artifacts) would apply ￼. This cost comes from OpenAI, not RepoPrompt itself.
- Paid Plans – For heavier usage, larger projects, or team features, RepoPrompt likely offers paid plans. These might be monthly subscriptions or pay-as-you-go pricing based on the number of prompts or volume of data processed. A paid plan could allow higher rate limits, priority processing, or additional features like private instance deployment. The exact pricing structure (such as tiered plans vs. consumption-based billing) would be detailed on RepoPrompt's official website. Enterprise plans might also exist for organizations needing integration at scale or on-premises setup.
- Open-Source Option – It's possible that RepoPrompt is available as an open-source project (for example, on GitHub) for self-hosting. If so, it means anyone can use the core software without licensing fees, running it locally or on their own servers. In this case, the only costs would be the infrastructure to run it and the API costs of the AI model. An open-source availability would indicate a community-driven approach, where improvements and fixes are contributed by users. Checking the official documentation or repository will confirm if this option exists.
- Availability of Updates – The tool is actively maintained, with updates rolled out to improve its features and support new models. Users can expect regular improvements, especially as underlying AI models evolve. For instance, if new models with larger context windows or lower costs become available, RepoPrompt will likely add support for them. Availability of the service is global (accessible online) unless restricted by the AI model's API region limitations.

In summary, RepoPrompt is accessible to users now, with a model that likely includes a free basic usage and scalable pricing for advanced needs. The exact pricing details and any usage limits are provided on the official site, and users should review those before extensive use. Regardless of RepoPrompt's own pricing, remember that using large AI models can incur significant token costs – for example, a very large prompt on GPT-4-32k will cost more due to the higher token count ￼. Thus, RepoPrompt encourages efficient prompt construction not just for technical reasons but also to minimize cost for the user.
