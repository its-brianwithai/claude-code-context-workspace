⚡ Prompts, Systems & Templates
My name == Brian. App developer, entrepenerd & undercover AI agent. Nowadays, I do somewhere between 70% to 90% of all my work with the help of AI. I have found that this is a lot lower for most people I talk too, which is why I created ultrawideturbodevs.com. Here I share everything I discover & use on a daily basis:

- 💬 Prompts
    - 🤖 System Prompts (You are a..)
    - 🦾 Activity Prompts (Please do..)
- 🔧 Tools
- 🏗️ Systems
- 📝 Templates
- 💡 Hacks
- 🧠 Tutorials

My primary focus always lies on efficiency, quality and immediate practicality without unnecessary fuss 🗣️. Everything I share comes straight out of my personal toolbox and is 100% free. If you find it useful you can register an account on ultrawideturbodevs.com and you’ll be among the first to receive an email as soon I have a new 🧊 cool 🧊 thing to share.

Stay turbo 🤙
