# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template for Flutter & Firebase/Supabase Projects**

## **I. Introduction & Purpose**

### **A. Document Overview**

This document provides a template for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) specifically tailored for software projects utilizing the Flutter framework with either Firebase or Supabase as the backend service. A PRD serves as a central artifact defining the product or feature to be built, outlining its purpose, features, functionalities, and behavior.1 It acts as a crucial communication bridge between the initial project concept and the detailed engineering implementation plan, ensuring alignment among stakeholders including product managers, designers, developers, testers, and marketing teams.1

This template is designed to be flexible, catering to both broad, project-scoped PRDs that define an entire new product or release, and more specific, feature-scoped PRDs that detail a single piece of functionality within a larger product.4 The goal is to provide "just enough" context and detail to guide development effectively within an agile environment, fostering collaboration and clarity without becoming overly burdensome or static.4

### **B. Purpose of *This Specific* PRD**

*(Instructions: Clearly state whether this PRD covers an entire project/release or a specific feature. Define the high-level objective of what is being documented.)*

**Example (Project Scope):** "This PRD outlines the requirements for the initial release (MVP) of the 'ConnectSphere' mobile application, a social networking platform built using Flutter and Firebase, focusing on core user profile creation, connection requests, and a basic activity feed."

**Example (Feature Scope):** "This PRD details the requirements for implementing the 'Real-time Chat' feature within the existing 'TaskMaster' Flutter/Supabase application, enabling users to communicate directly within project workspaces."

### **C. Intended Audience**

This document is intended for all stakeholders involved in the planning, design, development, testing, and launch of the specified product or feature. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Product Managers
* UI/UX Designers
* Flutter Developers (Frontend)
* Backend Developers (Firebase/Supabase)
* Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers
* Project Managers
* Marketing & Sales Teams (as applicable)
* Relevant Leadership/Executives 1

## **II. Goals & Objectives**

### **A. Product Vision & Strategic Fit**

*(Instructions: Briefly describe the overall vision for the product or how this specific feature fits into the larger product vision and company strategy. Answer "Why are we doing this?")* 4

This section sets the strategic context. It should articulate the high-level aspiration for the product or feature and explain its alignment with broader company goals or market opportunities.4 Understanding the strategic fit helps the team make informed decisions throughout the development process, ensuring the work contributes meaningfully to the organization's objectives.4

**Example (Project Scope):** "ConnectSphere aims to be the leading mobile platform for professional networking within the creative industries by fostering genuine connections through shared portfolio work. This aligns with the company's strategic goal of expanding into the creative professional market segment (Objective KR2.1)." 4

**Example (Feature Scope):** "The Real-time Chat feature directly supports TaskMaster's strategic objective of increasing user engagement and collaboration within the platform (Strategy Pillar 3). By enabling seamless communication, we aim to reduce reliance on external chat tools and make TaskMaster the central hub for project work." 4

### **B. Business Objectives & Success Metrics**

*(Instructions: List specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for this project/feature. Define the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or metrics that will be used to measure success.)* 2

Defining clear objectives and how success will be measured is crucial for evaluating the product's impact after launch.5 These metrics provide concrete targets for the team and justify the investment in development.11 Success metrics should cover relevant aspects like user adoption, engagement, performance, task success rates, or business outcomes.2

**Example Goals & Metrics:**

* **Goal 1:** Increase user sign-up conversion rate.
    * **Metric:** Achieve a 15% increase in the sign-up completion rate within 3 months post-launch.10
* **Goal 2:** Improve user engagement with the new chat feature.
    * **Metric:** Achieve an average of 5 chat messages sent per active user per week within the first month.13
    * **Metric:** 70% adoption rate of the chat feature (users sending at least one message) among active users within 2 months.
* **Goal 3:** Reduce user reliance on external communication tools.
    * **Metric:** Decrease in user-reported usage of external chat tools for project communication by 20% based on post-launch user surveys.
* **Goal 4:** Ensure high performance and reliability of the feature.

## **IV. User Personas**

*(Instructions: Define the primary and secondary target users for this product/feature. Link to more detailed persona documents if available.)* 2

Understanding the target users is fundamental to building a successful product.6 Personas represent archetypes of real users, encapsulating their goals, needs, behaviors, and pain points.7 Keeping these personas in mind throughout the design and development process helps ensure the final product effectively addresses user needs rather than just fulfilling a list of features.6

* **Primary Persona(s):** Describe the main user(s) this product/feature is designed for. Their needs should be the primary focus.9
    * **Example:** *Creative Professional (Freelance Graphic Designer):* Needs to easily showcase portfolio work, connect with potential clients, and manage project inquiries efficiently. Values intuitive UI and seamless mobile experience.
* **Secondary Persona(s):** Describe other users who might interact with the product/feature, but whose needs are not the central focus.9
    * **Example:** *Recruiter/Client:* Needs to quickly browse portfolios, assess skills, and initiate contact with creative professionals. Values efficient search and clear contact information.

*(Link to detailed Persona documents/research if they exist)* 11

## **V. Scope Definition**

*(Instructions: Clearly define what is included in this release and, just as importantly, what is explicitly excluded.)*

Defining the scope clearly upfront is essential for managing expectations, preventing scope creep, and ensuring the team stays focused on delivering the agreed-upon value within the given constraints.3 While agile methodologies embrace adapting to change, uncontrolled expansion of scope (scope creep) is a common reason for project delays and budget overruns.1 The "Out of Scope" section serves as a critical boundary marker.4

### **A. In Scope (Prioritized Features/User Stories)**

*(Instructions: List the specific features, user stories, or epics planned for this release. Use a prioritization method like MoSCoW.)* 2

The MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) provides a clear framework for prioritizing requirements, guiding decision-making when trade-offs are necessary due to time or resource limitations.5

| Feature/Story ID | Description | Priority | Rationale/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Must-have** | *(Essential for the core purpose/viability of this release)* 5 |  |  |
| US-001 | As a user, I want to create an account using email/password, so that I can log in. | Must | Core functionality required for any user interaction. |
| US-002 | As a user, I want to log in with my email/password, so that I can access my account. | Must | Core functionality. |
| FEAT-CHAT-01 | As a workspace member, I want to send a text message in a channel, so that I can communicate with my team. | Must | Minimum viable chat functionality. |
| **Should-have** | *(Important, but not critical for launch; workarounds may exist)* 20 |  |  |
| US-003 | As a user, I want to reset my password if forgotten, so that I can regain access. | Should | Important for user recovery, but launch possible without. |
| FEAT-CHAT-02 | As a workspace member, I want to see typing indicators, so that I know when someone is replying. | Should | Enhances UX, but basic chat works without it. |
| **Could-have** | *(Desirable, but less important; included if time/resources permit)* 20 |  |  |
| FEAT-CHAT-03 | As a workspace member, I want to react to messages with emojis, so that I can provide quick feedback. | Could | Nice-to-have engagement feature. |
| **Won't-have (This Release)** | *(Explicitly excluded from this specific release)* 4 |  |  |
| FEAT-CHAT-04 | Direct (1-to-1) messaging between users. | Won't | Deferred to v2.1 release. |
| US-004 | Account creation/login via Google OAuth. | Won't | Deferred to post-MVP enhancement. |

### **B. Out of Scope**

*(Instructions: Explicitly list features, functionalities, or user requests that are NOT included in this specific release. Note if they are deferred.)* 2

Clearly stating what is *not* being built is as crucial as defining what *is* being built. This prevents misunderstandings, manages stakeholder expectations, and provides a clear line against scope creep.4

* **Example:**
    * Integration with third-party project management tools.
    * Advanced user permission roles beyond 'Admin' and 'Member'.
    * Offline support for chat messages (deferred to future release).
    * Video or voice calling features.
    * End-to-end encryption for chat messages (under investigation for future release).

## **VI. Requirements**

This section forms the core of the PRD, detailing *what* the product or feature needs to do (functional requirements) and *how* it should perform (non-functional requirements).1

### **A. User Stories / Use Cases**

User stories are the preferred format in agile development for capturing requirements from the end-user's perspective, focusing on the value delivered.23 They facilitate conversation and ensure the team remains user-focused.24 Each story should be accompanied by clear acceptance criteria. For particularly complex interactions involving multiple steps or alternative flows, supplementing a user story with a linked use case description or flowchart can enhance clarity.22

*(Instructions: List the detailed user stories derived from the 'In Scope' features. Link stories to Epics if applicable. Ensure each story has clear Acceptance Criteria.)*

**Example User Story:**

* **ID:** US-001
* **Epic Link:** \[Link to User Authentication Epic\]
* **User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using my email address and a password, so that I can log in and access the application's features. 23
* **Acceptance Criteria:** 3
    * **Given** I am on the Sign-Up screen
    * **When** I enter a valid email address (format check)
    * **And** I enter a password meeting complexity requirements (e.g., min 8 chars, 1 number, 1 symbol)
    * **And** I confirm the password
    * **And** I tap the "Sign Up" button
    * **Then** my account is created in the backend (Firebase Auth/Supabase Auth).
    * **And** I am automatically logged in.
    * **And** I am redirected to the application's main dashboard/home screen.
    * **Given** I enter an invalid email format
    * **When** I tap "Sign Up"
    * **Then** I see an inline error message "Invalid email format".
    * **Given** I enter passwords that do not match
    * **When** I tap "Sign Up"
    * **Then** I see an inline error message "Passwords do not match".
    * **Given** I enter a password that does not meet complexity requirements
    * **When** I tap "Sign Up"
    * **Then** I see an inline error message detailing the password requirements.
    * **Given** an account with the entered email already exists
    * **When** I tap "Sign Up"
    * **Then** I see an error message "An account with this email already exists. Please log in."

*(Repeat for all in-scope user stories)*

### **B. Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements define *what* the system must do – its specific behaviors, features, and functions.32 While often captured within the acceptance criteria of user stories 3, this section can explicitly list system-level functions, business rules, data validation logic, or administrative capabilities not easily tied to a single story.

*(Instructions: List any specific functional requirements not adequately covered by user story acceptance criteria. Reference relevant user stories where applicable.)*

* **FR-01 (Data Validation):** All user-inputted text fields must sanitize input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **FR-02 (Business Rule):** User accounts inactive for more than 12 months must be flagged for potential deactivation.
* **FR-03 (Admin Function):** System administrators must have the capability to view application logs via the Firebase/Supabase console.36
* **FR-04 (Integration):** The system must successfully process payment callbacks from the Stripe API.34

### **C. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

NFRs define *how* the system should perform its functions, focusing on quality attributes like performance, security, usability, and reliability.32 These are critical for user satisfaction and overall product success, and neglecting them can lead to a functionally correct but practically unusable product.18 NFRs must be defined early and made specific and measurable wherever possible.32 The choice of Flutter and Firebase/Supabase directly influences the specific NFRs that need consideration.

## **XIV. Conclusion and Recommendations**

This PRD template provides a structured framework for defining requirements for Flutter applications utilizing Firebase or Supabase backends. Its core purpose is to foster clarity, alignment, and collaboration among all project stakeholders.1 By systematically addressing goals, scope, user needs, functional and non-functional requirements (including platform-specific considerations like accessibility and backend security), design integration, and release criteria, teams can mitigate risks associated with ambiguity and scope creep.12

**Key Recommendations for Use:**

1. **Adaptability:** Tailor this template to the specific needs of the project – whether it's a large-scale product launch or a single feature enhancement. Remove or simplify sections as appropriate, but ensure core elements like Goals, Scope, Requirements (including NFRs), and Release Criteria are always addressed.4
2. **Collaboration:** Treat the PRD as a collaborative artifact, not a dictatorial mandate.1 Involve design, engineering, and other stakeholders early and often in its creation and refinement.1
3. **Living Document:** Recognize that requirements may evolve.2 Maintain the PRD throughout the development lifecycle, using the Version History and Open Questions sections to track changes and unresolved issues.2 Link dynamically to design artifacts and issue trackers (like Jira or GitHub Issues) where possible to keep information synchronized.4
4. **Platform Specificity:** Pay close attention to Sections VI.C (NFRs) and VIII (Backend Specifications). Explicitly address the requirements and constraints imposed by Flutter and the chosen backend (Firebase or Supabase), particularly concerning performance, scalability, security rules (Firebase Rules/Supabase RLS), and data modeling.43
5. **Focus on the 'Why':** Consistently link features and requirements back to the user personas, problem statements, and overall goals to ensure the team understands the purpose behind the work.1

By utilizing this template thoughtfully and collaboratively, teams can establish a shared understanding, make informed decisions, and ultimately build higher-quality Flutter applications that effectively meet user needs and business objectives.
