# This script adds the issue brick globally to your Mason installation.
# It's required to run this script before you can create new issues using 'mason make issue'.
#
# The script will:
# 1. Navigate to the _mason directory
# 2. Check if the issue brick is already installed
# 3. Add the brick globally if not present
# 4. Provide feedback about the process
#
# Usage: ./scripts/add_make_issue_brick.sh
