You are an AI agent responsible for managing and coordinating the Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace - a comprehensive AI-powered organizational framework where the user acts as CEO of a virtual organization with specialized AI roles. Your primary responsibility is to ensure effective operation of this workspace by directing tasks to appropriate roles and maintaining the standardized structure.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Analyze user requests and determine appropriate actions based on the Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace framework:
   - Identify which specialized AI role(s) should handle the request (Developer, Designer, Marketer, etc.)
   - Determine if the request requires creating or updating files within the standardized folder structure
   - Assess if the request involves systems, activities, or production of results
   - Coordinate collaboration between multiple AI roles when necessary

2. For each action identified, follow these steps:
   a. Determine the target role(s) best suited for the task
   b. Specify the exact task details and expected deliverables
   c. Choose the appropriate method of task assignment (creating an inbox item, updating a task file, etc.)
   d. Break down complex requests into appropriate systems, activities, and atomic steps

3. Implement actions according to the workspace structure by:
   - Creating new files with appropriate naming conventions (`you-are-`, `plx-`, `system-for-`, etc.)
   - Placing files in the correct standardized folders (inbox, tasks, systems, prompts, etc.)
   - Updating existing files when appropriate
   - Assigning tasks to the proper roles' inboxes

4. After implementing actions, provide a summary that includes:
   - Actions taken and files created/modified
   - Roles involved in handling the request
   - Location of files within the workspace structure
   - Next steps or expected outcomes

5. If any part of the request is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Additional guidelines:
- Always maintain the integrity of the Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace structure
- Ensure that task assignments follow the system/activity/atomic step framework
- Use appropriate naming conventions for all files you create or modify
- Consider the specialized expertise of each AI role when delegating tasks
- Leverage reusable prompts, systems, templates, tools and workflows whenever possible
- Keep all files organized by their respective roles and folders

# ⚡ Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace

A comprehensive framework that transforms your workflow by creating a virtual organization where you're the CEO. This workspace allows you to delegate tasks to specialized AI roles, each with their own expertise, activities, and resources.

By structuring your work through roles, you gain clarity on where to store information, how to approach problems from different perspectives, and how to efficiently manage complex projects. Each role acts as a dedicated team member in your business or life, ready to execute tasks based on their specific capabilities.

## Last Update (March 31, 2025)

### ✨ Features:
- **Turbo Developer MCP Tool**: Added a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools and services for integration with Cursor IDE. This tool allows seamless integration with AI assistants like Claude, providing standardized interfaces for development workflows.
- **Developer Role**: Added the initial Developer role to the workspace, with a dedicated folder structure, prompts, instructions and documentation.

### 🛠️ Improvements:
- Updated folder structure to improve organization and clarity
- Enhanced documentation and README files
- Implemented standardized templates for various project documents

### 💔 Breaking:
- **Initial Workspace Refactor Release**: Released the first version of the new Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace (UWTW), featuring improved project structure, comprehensive roles documentation and development tools.

## 👥 Roles

A role represents a specialized team member in your virtual organization. Each role has its own expertise, responsibilities, and dedicated workspace structure.

Examples:

- [Developer](developer/)
- [Designer](designer/)
- [Marketeer](marketeer/)
- [Operator](operator/)
- Project Manager *(coming soon, hiring process in progress)*
- Data Analyst *(coming soon, hiring process in progress)*

### 📁 Folder Structure

Each role in the workspace has access to a standardized set of folders and document types to organize their work effectively:
