# üß† Project Context
> The file paths contain important contextual information about the project's architecture, conventions, rules and collections.
>
> Use your best judgement to determine which files are relevant to your task and read them before planning any approach.
>
> All files starting with `@` contain essential information that is relevant to every task and should ALWAYS be read at the start of every conversation.
> 
> > üí° All file paths are relative to the root of the project repository.
> > ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT use backticks (`) in file paths to avoid breaking the automatic reading of files that some AI tools like Claude Code facilitate.
