      AuthService --> |Interacts with Backend| BackendAuth
      BackendAuth -- Succeeded --> AuthService
      AuthService -- Success --> LoginViewModel
      LoginViewModel --> |Navigates| HomeScreen
      AuthService -- Failed --> LoginViewModel
      LoginViewModel --> |Shows Error| LoginScreen
