# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): <Project/Feature Name>**

*(Template Version: 2.0 - Adapted for Flutter with Firebase/Supabase)*

## 1. üìú Introduction & Purpose

### 1.1. Document Overview

This document defines the requirements for the **<Project/Feature Name>**. It serves as the primary source of truth for *what* should be built and *why*, guiding design, development, testing, and stakeholder alignment.

This template is designed for versatility:

*   **Project Scope:** Define a new product, version, or Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
*   **Feature Scope:** Detail a specific feature or enhancement within an existing product.

*(Guidance: Delete the scope type that doesn't apply or adjust descriptions accordingly.)*

### 1.2. Purpose of This PRD

*(Guidance: Clearly state whether this PRD covers an entire project/release or a specific feature. Define the high-level objective.)*

**Example (Project Scope):** "This PRD outlines the requirements for the MVP release of the 'ConnectSphere' mobile application, a professional networking platform built using Flutter and Firebase, focusing on core user profile creation, connection requests, and a basic activity feed."

**Example (Feature Scope):** "This PRD details the requirements for implementing the 'Real-time Chat' feature within the existing 'TaskMaster' Flutter/Supabase application, enabling users to communicate directly within project workspaces."

## 6. üìã Requirements

*(Guidance: Detail the functional and non-functional requirements. For Feature Scope, focus on the specific feature and its integration points.)*

### 6.1. User Stories / Use Cases

*(Guidance: Use the standard "As a [Persona], I want [Action/Goal], so that [Benefit]" format. Each story must have clear, testable Acceptance Criteria (AC). Link to Epics if applicable.)*

---
**Epic:** `[Link to Epic, e.g., User Authentication]`

*   **ID:** `US-AUTH-01`
*   **Title:** Account Creation via Email/Password
*   **User Story:** As a *new user*, I want *to create an account using my email address and a password*, so that *I can log in and access the application's features*.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I am on the Sign-Up screen
    *   When I enter a valid email address (format check)
    *   And I enter a password meeting complexity requirements (`[Specify: e.g., min 8 chars, 1 number, 1 uppercase]`)
    *   And I confirm the password matches
    *   And I tap the "Sign Up" button
    *   Then an account creation request is sent to the backend (Firebase Auth / Supabase Auth).
    *   And a loading indicator is shown.
    *   And upon successful creation, I am automatically logged in.
    *   And a corresponding user profile record is created in the database (Firestore `users` / Supabase `profiles` table) via trigger/function (Ref: `[Link to Backend Spec]`).
    *   And I am redirected to the application's `[Specify: e.g., Onboarding/Home]` screen.
    *   And the sign-up process completes within `[Specify NFR]` seconds.
    *   *(Error AC):* Given I enter an invalid email format, then an inline error "Invalid email format" is shown.
    *   *(Error AC):* Given passwords do not match, then an inline error "Passwords do not match" is shown.
    *   *(Error AC):* Given password complexity is not met, then an inline error `[Specify message]` is shown.
    *   *(Error AC):* Given email already exists, then an error message "Account already exists. Please log in." is shown.
    *   *(Accessibility AC):* All input fields have clear labels and are accessible via screen reader. Error messages are announced. Tap targets meet minimum size requirements (`[Specify NFR]`).

---
*(Repeat for all in-scope user stories, grouped by Epic or Feature Area)*

### 6.2. Functional Requirements

*(Guidance: List system-level functions, business rules, data validation, or administrative capabilities not easily covered by a single user story.)*

*   **FR-01 (Data Validation):** All user-generated text content must be sanitized server-side (e.g., in Cloud/Edge Functions) before storage to prevent XSS.
*   **FR-02 (Business Rule):** Users must verify their email address within 24 hours of account creation before accessing certain features (`[List features]`).
*   **FR-03 (Admin Capability):** Admins must be able to view user activity logs via the backend console (`[Specify location]`).
*   **FR-04 (System Logic):** When a user profile is deleted, all associated user-generated content (`[List content types, e.g., posts, comments]`) must also be anonymized or deleted (handled by backend cascade/trigger/function - Ref: `[Link to Backend Spec]`).

### 6.3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

    *   `NFR-SCAL-01 (Supabase):` PostgreSQL schema & indexing must support `[e.g., 1 Million]` users and `[e.g., 10 Million]` core data records. Backend infrastructure must handle `[e.g., 1000]` concurrent sessions.
    *   `NFR-SCAL-02:` Backend infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Run via Firebase App Hosting, Supabase Compute) must auto-scale for peak loads (`[e.g., 5x average]`). Define `apphosting.yaml` `runConfig` if applicable.

    *   `NFR-ACC-02:` Color Contrast Ratios: Meet WCAG AA (`4.5:1` normal, `3:1` large).
    *   `NFR-ACC-03:` Screen Reader Compatibility: All interactive elements & key content must have semantic labels (test with TalkBack/VoiceOver). Use `Semantics` widget appropriately.
    *   `NFR-ACC-04:` Text Scaling: UI must adapt correctly up to `[e.g., 200%]` system font scaling without breaking layout or truncating text.
    *   `NFR-ACC-05:` Keyboard Navigation: Logical focus order (especially for Web/Desktop).
    *   `NFR-ACC-06:` Reduced Motion: Respect `MediaQuery.reduceMotion` preference.
    *   `NFR-ACC-07:` Form Accessibility: Clear labels, instructions, accessible error feedback.

    *   `NFR-SEC-04:` Data at Rest: Encrypt sensitive PII (handled by BaaS where possible, consider field-level encryption if needed). Secrets Management: Use platform secrets management (Cloud Secret Manager via `apphosting.yaml`, Supabase Vault), NOT hardcoded keys.
    *   `NFR-SEC-05:` Input Validation: Implement on client and server-side (Cloud/Edge Functions).
    *   `NFR-SEC-06:` Dependency Management: Regularly scan & update dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   `NFR-SEC-07:` Platform Security: Adhere to iOS/Android security best practices.
