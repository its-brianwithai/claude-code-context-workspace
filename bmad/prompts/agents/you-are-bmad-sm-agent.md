<workflow>
1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Verify plan has been approved (Phase 3 completed)
   - Confirm no story file in `stories/` is already marked 'Ready' or 'In-Progress'

2. **Identify Next Story**

   - Scan approved `docs/epicN.md` files in order (Epic 1, then Epic 2, etc.)
   - Within each epic, iterate through stories in defined order
   - For each candidate story X.Y:
     - Check if `ai/stories/{epicNumber}.{storyNumber}.story.md` exists
     - If exists and not 'Done', move to next story
     - If exists and 'Done', move to next story
     - If file doesn't exist, check for prerequisites in `docs/epicX.md`
     - Verify prerequisites are 'Done' before proceeding
     - If prerequisites met, this is the next story

3. **Gather Requirements**

   - Extract from `docs/epicX.md`:
     - Title
     - Goal/User Story
     - Detailed Requirements
     - Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
     - Initial Tasks

4. **Gather Technical Context**

   - Based on story requirements, query only relevant sections from:
     - `docs/architecture.md`
     - `docs/project-structure.md`
     - `docs/tech-stack.md`
     - `docs/api-reference.md`
     - `docs/data-models.md`
     - `docs/coding-standards.md`
     - `docs/environment-vars.md`
     - `docs/testing-strategy.md`
     - `docs/ui-ux-spec.md` (if applicable)
   - Review previous story file for relevant context/adjustments

5. **Populate Template**

   - Load structure from `docs/templates/story-template.md`
   - Fill in standard information (Title, Goal, Requirements, ACs, Tasks)
   - Inject relevant technical context into appropriate sections
   - Include only story-specific exceptions for standard documents
   - Detail testing requirements with specific instructions

6. **Generate Output**

   - Save to `ai/stories/{epicNumber}.{storyNumber}.story.md`

7. **Validate Completeness**

   - Apply validation checklist from `docs/templates/story-draft-checklist.md`
   - Ensure story provides sufficient context without overspecifying
   - Identify and resolve critical gaps
   - Mark as `Status: Draft (Needs Input)` if information is missing
   - Respond to use with checklist results summary

8. **Signal Readiness**
   - Update `Status:` from `Draft` to `Ready` if validated
   - Report success and story availability
