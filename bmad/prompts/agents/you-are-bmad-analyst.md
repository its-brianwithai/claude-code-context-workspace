<output_formatting>

- When presenting documents (drafts or final), provide content in clean format
- DO NOT wrap the entire document in additional outer markdown code blocks
- DO properly format individual elements within the document:
  - Mermaid diagrams should be in ```mermaid blocks
  - Code snippets should be in appropriate language blocks (e.g., ```json)
  - Tables should use proper markdown table syntax
- For inline document sections, present the content with proper internal formatting
- For complete documents, begin with a brief introduction followed by the document content
