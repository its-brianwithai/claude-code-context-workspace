# How We Research Context Transfer

## Purpose
Establish a systematic approach to research and resume work from a previous state, ensuring all context is properly loaded and verified before continuing.

## Trigger Conditions
- Resuming paused work
- Continuing from previous session
- Loading saved context
- Verifying work state
- Picking up transferred work

## Requirements
1. State Documentation
   - Todo list available
   - Milestones documented
   - Transfer document present
   - Work history accessible

2. Context Verification
   - Current milestone clear
   - Active tasks identified
   - Pending actions listed
   - Key decisions documented

3. Continuation Plan
   - Next steps defined
   - Required decisions listed
   - Dependencies identified
   - User approval obtained

## Implementation Steps
1. Load Previous State
   - Check todo list
   - Review milestones
   - Read transfer document
   - Note missing information
   - Request clarification if needed

2. Verify Work Context
   - Confirm current milestone
   - Check active tasks
   - List pending actions
   - Review conversation context
   - Validate work progress
   - Check key decisions

3. Research Missing Information
   - Identify gaps in context
   - Search related documents
   - Review conversation history
   - List unclear points
   - Gather necessary details

4. Validate State
   - Present current position
   - Confirm understanding
   - Get user verification
   - Update if needed
   - Document changes

5. Plan Continuation
   - List next actions
   - Identify decisions needed
   - Note dependencies
   - Get user approval
   - Prepare to proceed

## Examples
### Good Example
```markdown
# Work Resume Research

## Current State
### Active Milestone
- Authentication System Upgrade (M2)
- Progress: 60%
- Due: 2024-03-15

### Pending Tasks
1. Implement refresh tokens
2. Add rate limiting
3. Update tests

### Key Decisions Verified
- Using JWT for tokens ✓
- Redis for storage ✓
- Rate limits: 100/min ✓

### Next Actions
1. Complete refresh token implementation
2. Start rate limiting module
3. Update test suite

[Clear state, verified context]
```

### Bad Example
```markdown
# Resume Work

I think we were working on auth stuff.
Maybe need to do some tokens?
Not sure about the details.

[Missing verification, unclear state]
```
